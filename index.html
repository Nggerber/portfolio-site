                    Hello my name is Neal Gerber, I was born and raised in Boulder Colorado. 
                    Growing up so close to the mountains had a profound impact on me. Be it 
                    backpacking in the Rocky Mountains, trail running around town or rock 
                    climbing I felt at home outdoors. This respect for the outdoors took me to Eugene 
                    Oregon for my undergraduate degree of biology but it really served to fuel
                    my passion for rock climbing. After school I moved to Salt Lake City to be closer 
                    the mountains and see how far I could push my climbing. After six years of working
                    in the outdoor industry I sought a career change that would support my lifestyle
                    and encourage my creativity. For this I turned to my I turned to my other passion 
                    is suprisingly computers. I've always enjoyed messing around on a computer, playing
                    video games or exploring the far reaches of the interenet. During highschool I had 
                    taken several coding courses in Java and C++ which I thouroghly enjoyed so much so that
                    I took a couple more in college. Unfortunately I never viewed computer science as 
                    a career path until now. This has led me to the fullstack program where I hope to
                    lay the foundation for a new career in web development. I think that I will be able to apply 
                    my hardworking personality to the world of web development and really be an excellent addition to any
                    team.
                </p>
